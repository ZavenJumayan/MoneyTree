# Wymood — AI Mood Detection App

Wymood is an AI-powered mood detection web app built with **Next.js**, **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Shadcn/UI**.  
Users enter a short text, and the app analyzes the emotional tone (positive, negative, neutral, stressed, etc.) using a custom AI-powered API route.

This project demonstrates modern full-stack capabilities inside the Next.js App Router while focusing strongly on **front-end development, UI/UX, component design, and client–server communication**.
